##### TODO #####

Make
  clean Makefile
  1. create env file in makefile,
    2. then load from env file in terraform

CICD
  add precommit rule to make graph

Functional
  add firewall to cloud run from specific IP addresses in env file (start with one). Currently no auth.

Terraform
  Set restricted ingress
  Make terraform into a template
  Separate .tf from .tfvars

  + separate terraform concerns into multiple files
  + connect resources (e.g. service account) via variables. Use output?
  make it so that a new topic can easily be added, along with pubs and subs, by changing a variable






##### Questions #####

Makefile:
  How do I prevent $$(...) from also executing the output/return. OR: How can I make $() work?

Functional
  Why can't I destroy the pubsub api?

Why define PORT into variable when it is fixed?
